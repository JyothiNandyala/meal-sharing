          Meal Sharing enables travelers and locals to connect with each other
          over home-cooked meals. The online application builds community,
          promotes cultural exchange, and encourages people to live healthier
          lives through the delicious world of food.

          Meal-sharing apps like Feastly, EatWith, and Cookapp, are basically
          like Airbnb for meals. They connect tourists with locals and are
          changing the way people travel.

          I decided to be a tourist within my own city and try out one of these
          apps. I signed myself up for Feastly, and booked a $42 dinner of
          unique handmade pizzas prepared by a woman named Michelle, who lives
          in Union Square, in the center of Manhattan. The three other guests I
          shared the meal with were all tourists visiting New York City from
          other countries.
